# Binary-Search-Tree
Write a program to build a tree and print it using preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.

Printing in traversal
  a node will print, intended by 2 x depth of the node, the string length followed by list of strings from the node without repetitions
Example will be built in class
  File xxx.sp19 contains
  adam ala ada jim ala susan george georg john
  invocation: > P0 xxx
    Output files: xxx.inorder xxx.preorder xxx.postorder
  Invocation: > P0 < xxx.sp19 \\ or > P0 with interactive input followed by EOF
    Output files: out.inorder out.preorder out.postorder
